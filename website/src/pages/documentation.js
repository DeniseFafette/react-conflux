              Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour,
              right? God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates
              Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. Hey, you know how
              I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance.

              We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air,
              and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet
              enough, they won't want it anymore! Must go faster... go, go, go,
              go, go! Life finds a way. I was part of something special.
            </p>

            <p>
              Yes, Yes, without the oops! What do they got in there? King Kong?
              Just my luck, no ice. God help us, we're in the hands of
              engineers. They're using our own satellites against us. And the
              clock is ticking. They're using our own satellites against us. And
              the clock is ticking.

              about you little bastard!

              Must go faster. Checkmate... Just my luck, no ice. Checkmate... My
              dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and
              I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! Yeah, but
              your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they
              could, they didn't stop to think if they should.

              Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us
              out of here! So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? You know what?
              It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. They're using our own
              satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. You're a very

              you need a manager?

              Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! Did he just throw my cat out
              of the window? My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs
              with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little

              Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my
              espresso machine? Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist?
              They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is
              ticking. Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! You're a

              Checkmate... Life finds a way. God help us, we're in the hands of
              engineers. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus.
              So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? This thing comes fully
              loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows.
